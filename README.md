21. How much is 1 gwei of Ether?
    => 1 ether = 10^9 gwei
23. How much is 1 wei of Ether?
    => 1 ether = 10^18 wei
24. What is the difference between assert and require?

26. What is a flash loan?
27. What is the check-effects pattern?
    => it's a pattern that requires the checks to happen at the start of the function before the effects like variable updates
28. What is the minimum amount of Ether required to run a solo staking node?
    =>32ETH
30. What is the difference between fallback and receive?
    => msg.data
31. What is reentrancy?
    => the process of entering a function more times than we are allowed usually via external calls badly placed. There are several kinds of reentrancies such as cross-contract classic reentrancy, reentrancies, cross-functions reentrancies, read-only reentrancy

    => 2^256 - 1
43. What is variable and fixed interest rate?
    => when taking a loan that you have to repay with interest, there are 2 kinds of interests fixed rate: that stays the same and is known when you take the loan and variable rate that can vary since the loan was taken.
